# wbweb Development Progress

This file tracks session-by-session progress on the wbweb extraction project.

## Session 1 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Establish project structure and collaboration method
- Analyze wbgpt components for extraction
- Create tracking system for long-term work

### Completed
- ✅ Analyzed wbgpt.core structure comprehensively
- ✅ Identified generic components suitable for extraction
- ✅ Updated README.md with project goals
- ✅ Created file-based knowledge structure for collaboration
- ✅ Established EXTRACTION_PLAN.md with phases and components

### Key Findings
- wbgpt has excellent separation between generic framework and business logic
- Core components are well-structured and minimally coupled
- Main components to extract:
  - Web layer (content negotiation, decorators)
  - Template system (Hiccup renderer)
  - Database layer (Django-style SQLAlchemy managers)
  - Settings system (generic configuration)

### Next Session Goals
- Design detailed wbweb package structure
- Begin extraction of first component (likely HiccupRenderer as it's most isolated)
- Set up proper Python package structure for wbweb

### Notes
- Components are very clean and should extract easily
- Minimal cleanup needed for wbgpt-specific logic
- Framework has good test coverage which will help validation

## Session 2 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Create systematic structure analysis tool
- Identify optimal extraction order based on coupling analysis
- Determine first component for extraction

### Completed
- ✅ Created `analysis/structure_analyzer.py` - reusable codebase analysis tool
- ✅ Analyzed all 9 wbgpt/core components systematically
- ✅ Generated dependency graph and coupling scores
- ✅ Identified 3 components ready for immediate extraction
- ✅ Detected 6 components requiring business logic cleanup

### Key Findings
**Ready for Extraction (Zero Coupling, No Business Logic):**
- `templates.hiccup` - 34 LOC, HiccupRenderer class
- `templates.renderers` - 74 LOC, renderer strategy classes
- `web.negotiation` - 27 LOC, ContentNegotiator class

**Needs Cleanup Before Extraction:**
- Database layer: `managers`, `config`, `base` (contains business logic)
- Web layer: `exceptions`, `decorators` (contains business logic)
- `settings` (contains business logic)

**Optimal First Extraction Target:**
- `templates.hiccup` - Most isolated, pure generic functionality

### Analysis Results
- Total components: 9 (3 generic, 6 business)
- Extraction ready: 3 components
- Analysis tool created as permanent regression test
- Detailed results saved to `analysis/wbgpt_analysis.json`

### Completed (Session 2 Continued)
- ✅ **Extracted HiccupRenderer successfully**
  - Created complete wbweb package structure (`wbweb/core/templates/`)
  - Copied HiccupRenderer implementation (34 LOC, zero changes needed)
  - Set up proper `__init__.py` files with clean public API
  - Extracted and adapted comprehensive test suite (5 tests)
  - Created extraction verification framework (9 verification tests)
  - **All 14 tests passing** - extraction fully validated

### Implementation Details
- **Package Structure**: `wbweb/core/templates/hiccup.py`
- **Public API**: `from wbweb import HiccupRenderer, HiccupTree`
- **Module API**: `from wbweb.core.templates import HiccupRenderer, HiccupTree`
- **Test Coverage**: Original functionality tests + extraction verification tests
- **Zero Modifications**: Code works identically to original

### Next Session Goals
- Extract `templates.renderers` as second component
- Extract `web.negotiation` as third component  
- Set up wbweb as installable package with proper dependencies

### Notes
- Structure analyzer provides data-driven extraction guidance
- Business logic detection worked well (keyword-based approach)
- Zero internal dependencies between core components simplifies extraction
- All high-priority components are in templates/ and web/ directories
- **First extraction completed successfully** - methodology validated
- Created permanent verification framework for future extractions

## Session 3 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Extract remaining extraction-ready components (ContentNegotiator and renderers)
- Complete the templates package entirely
- Validate all extractions with comprehensive testing

### Completed
- ✅ **Analyzed dependency complexity** of remaining components
  - Determined ContentNegotiator (27 LOC) simpler than renderers (74 LOC)
  - Both use `starlette.requests.Request` but ContentNegotiator has simpler usage
- ✅ **Extracted ContentNegotiator successfully**
  - Created `wbweb/core/web/` package structure
  - Added starlette dependency to pyproject.toml
  - Created comprehensive test suite (6 tests, all passing)
  - Updated main package exports
- ✅ **Extracted complete renderer strategy system**
  - Extracted DefaultRenderer with full Accept header content negotiation
  - Extracted UIRenderer and ApiRenderer (replacing temporary placeholders)
  - Created comprehensive test suite (14 tests covering all functionality)
  - **Templates package now 100% complete**
- ✅ **All 3 extraction-ready components extracted and validated**
  - HiccupRenderer (Session 2) + ContentNegotiator + All renderers (Session 3)
  - Total: 135 LOC of generic framework code successfully extracted

### Implementation Details
- **Package Structure**: Complete wbweb.core.templates and wbweb.core.web packages
- **Dependencies**: Added starlette>=0.20.0 for Request handling
- **Public API**: All components available from both module and package level imports
- **Test Coverage**: 34 core tests passing (renderers, negotiator, hiccup, verification)
- **Zero Code Modifications**: All extracted code works identically to original

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Dependency Resolution**: Solved UIRenderer/ApiRenderer import dependency by extracting renderers after negotiator
- **Package Design**: Clean separation between templates (rendering) and web (negotiation) concerns
- **Testing Strategy**: Mock Request objects to avoid complex starlette test dependencies
- **API Completeness**: Full feature parity with wbgpt originals

### Next Session Goals
- Clean up subprocess-based testing patterns (noted as unconventional)
- Set up wbweb as installable package with proper build configuration
- Begin extraction of business-logic components (after cleanup)
- Document extraction methodology for future framework development

### Notes
- **Methodology Validation**: Structure-preserving transformation approach proved highly effective
- **Clean Architecture**: All extracted components have zero internal coupling, making extraction straightforward
- **Test Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage provides confidence in extraction correctness
- **Templates Package Complete**: First major subsystem fully extracted and functional
- **Starlette Integration**: Successfully integrated web framework dependency without issues
