## Session 2 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Create systematic structure analysis tool
- Identify optimal extraction order based on coupling analysis
- Determine first component for extraction

### Completed
- ✅ Created `analysis/structure_analyzer.py` - reusable codebase analysis tool
- ✅ Analyzed all 9 wbgpt/core components systematically
- ✅ Generated dependency graph and coupling scores
- ✅ Identified 3 components ready for immediate extraction
- ✅ Detected 6 components requiring business logic cleanup

### Key Findings
**Ready for Extraction (Zero Coupling, No Business Logic):**
- `templates.hiccup` - 34 LOC, HiccupRenderer class
- `templates.renderers` - 74 LOC, renderer strategy classes
- `web.negotiation` - 27 LOC, ContentNegotiator class

**Needs Cleanup Before Extraction:**
- Database layer: `managers`, `config`, `base` (contains business logic)
- Web layer: `exceptions`, `decorators` (contains business logic)
- `settings` (contains business logic)

**Optimal First Extraction Target:**
- `templates.hiccup` - Most isolated, pure generic functionality

### Analysis Results
- Total components: 9 (3 generic, 6 business)
- Extraction ready: 3 components
- Analysis tool created as permanent regression test
- Detailed results saved to `analysis/wbgpt_analysis.json`

### Completed (Session 2 Continued)
- ✅ **Extracted HiccupRenderer successfully**
  - Created complete wbweb package structure (`wbweb/core/templates/`)
  - Copied HiccupRenderer implementation (34 LOC, zero changes needed)
  - Set up proper `__init__.py` files with clean public API
  - Extracted and adapted comprehensive test suite (5 tests)
  - Created extraction verification framework (9 verification tests)
  - **All 14 tests passing** - extraction fully validated

### Implementation Details
- **Package Structure**: `wbweb/core/templates/hiccup.py`
- **Public API**: `from wbweb import HiccupRenderer, HiccupTree`
- **Module API**: `from wbweb.core.templates import HiccupRenderer, HiccupTree`
- **Test Coverage**: Original functionality tests + extraction verification tests
- **Zero Modifications**: Code works identically to original

### Next Session Goals
