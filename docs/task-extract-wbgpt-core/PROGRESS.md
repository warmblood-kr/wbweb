# wbweb Development Progress

This file tracks session-by-session progress on the wbweb extraction project.

## Session 1 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Establish project structure and collaboration method
- Analyze wbgpt components for extraction
- Create tracking system for long-term work

### Completed
- ✅ Analyzed wbgpt.core structure comprehensively
- ✅ Identified generic components suitable for extraction
- ✅ Updated README.md with project goals
- ✅ Created file-based knowledge structure for collaboration
- ✅ Established EXTRACTION_PLAN.md with phases and components

### Key Findings
- wbgpt has excellent separation between generic framework and business logic
- Core components are well-structured and minimally coupled
- Main components to extract:
  - Web layer (content negotiation, decorators)
  - Template system (Hiccup renderer)
  - Database layer (Django-style SQLAlchemy managers)
  - Settings system (generic configuration)

### Next Session Goals
- Design detailed wbweb package structure
- Begin extraction of first component (likely HiccupRenderer as it's most isolated)
- Set up proper Python package structure for wbweb

### Notes
- Components are very clean and should extract easily
- Minimal cleanup needed for wbgpt-specific logic
- Framework has good test coverage which will help validation
