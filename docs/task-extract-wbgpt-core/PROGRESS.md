# wbweb Development Progress

This file tracks session-by-session progress on the wbweb extraction project.

## Session 1 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Establish project structure and collaboration method
- Analyze wbgpt components for extraction
- Create tracking system for long-term work

### Completed
- ✅ Analyzed wbgpt.core structure comprehensively
- ✅ Identified generic components suitable for extraction
- ✅ Updated README.md with project goals
- ✅ Created file-based knowledge structure for collaboration
- ✅ Established EXTRACTION_PLAN.md with phases and components

### Key Findings
- wbgpt has excellent separation between generic framework and business logic
- Core components are well-structured and minimally coupled
- Main components to extract:
  - Web layer (content negotiation, decorators)
  - Template system (Hiccup renderer)
  - Database layer (Django-style SQLAlchemy managers)
  - Settings system (generic configuration)

### Next Session Goals
- Design detailed wbweb package structure
- Begin extraction of first component (likely HiccupRenderer as it's most isolated)
- Set up proper Python package structure for wbweb

### Notes
- Components are very clean and should extract easily
- Minimal cleanup needed for wbgpt-specific logic
- Framework has good test coverage which will help validation

## Session 2 - 2025-06-19

### Goals
- Create systematic structure analysis tool
- Identify optimal extraction order based on coupling analysis
- Determine first component for extraction

### Completed
- ✅ Created `analysis/structure_analyzer.py` - reusable codebase analysis tool
- ✅ Analyzed all 9 wbgpt/core components systematically
- ✅ Generated dependency graph and coupling scores
- ✅ Identified 3 components ready for immediate extraction
- ✅ Detected 6 components requiring business logic cleanup

### Key Findings
**Ready for Extraction (Zero Coupling, No Business Logic):**
- `templates.hiccup` - 34 LOC, HiccupRenderer class
- `templates.renderers` - 74 LOC, renderer strategy classes
- `web.negotiation` - 27 LOC, ContentNegotiator class

**Needs Cleanup Before Extraction:**
- Database layer: `managers`, `config`, `base` (contains business logic)
- Web layer: `exceptions`, `decorators` (contains business logic)
- `settings` (contains business logic)

**Optimal First Extraction Target:**
- `templates.hiccup` - Most isolated, pure generic functionality

### Analysis Results
- Total components: 9 (3 generic, 6 business)
- Extraction ready: 3 components
- Analysis tool created as permanent regression test
- Detailed results saved to `analysis/wbgpt_analysis.json`

### Completed (Session 2 Continued)
- ✅ **Extracted HiccupRenderer successfully**
  - Created complete wbweb package structure (`wbweb/core/templates/`)
  - Copied HiccupRenderer implementation (34 LOC, zero changes needed)
  - Set up proper `__init__.py` files with clean public API
  - Extracted and adapted comprehensive test suite (5 tests)
  - Created extraction verification framework (9 verification tests)
  - **All 14 tests passing** - extraction fully validated

### Implementation Details
- **Package Structure**: `wbweb/core/templates/hiccup.py`
- **Public API**: `from wbweb import HiccupRenderer, HiccupTree`
- **Module API**: `from wbweb.core.templates import HiccupRenderer, HiccupTree`
- **Test Coverage**: Original functionality tests + extraction verification tests
- **Zero Modifications**: Code works identically to original

### Next Session Goals
- Extract `templates.renderers` as second component
- Extract `web.negotiation` as third component  
- Set up wbweb as installable package with proper dependencies

### Notes
- Structure analyzer provides data-driven extraction guidance
- Business logic detection worked well (keyword-based approach)
- Zero internal dependencies between core components simplifies extraction
- All high-priority components are in templates/ and web/ directories
- **First extraction completed successfully** - methodology validated
- Created permanent verification framework for future extractions
